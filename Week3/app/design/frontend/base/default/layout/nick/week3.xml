        When the response is ready to go back to the browser from the layout object, it calls (in the controller,
        specifically Mage_Core_Controller_Varien_Action::renderLayout()):
            
            $this->getLayout()->getUpdate()->getOutput();
            
        Inside getOutput() it loops through all of the blocks that have an output="" attribute and calls the method
        that's the value of the output attribute, so in this case it would call Mage_Core_Block_Text::toHtml().
        
        There can be multiple "output" blocks, and they are called one after each other.
        -->
        <block type="core/text" name="text" output="toHtml">
            <action method="setText"><text>Hello World</text></action>
        </block>
    </foo>
